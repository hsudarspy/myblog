You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

## Sample Heading

A simple program that displays “Hello, World!”. It's often used to illustrate the syntax of the language.


### Sample Heading 2

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```python
def print_anything(name):
  print(name)

Input:
print_anything('hello')

Output:
hello

```
